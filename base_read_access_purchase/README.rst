  acccess rights to purchases

Known issues / Roadmap
======================
* Note that as a byproduct this module grants read access to other models 
  that are utilized on e.g. purchase-related forms. This means the user
  could read e.g. invoices indirectly (via XMLRPC or by following hyperlink 
  paths inside Odoo), even though the accounting menu remains invisible
