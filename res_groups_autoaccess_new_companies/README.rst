=========================================
Group: Autoaccess Newly Created Companies
=========================================

* Adds a new group whose users automatically get access to new companies
* Intended for situations where it's common for additional companies to be added into
  Odoo, but the same earlier administrator users should have the rights to them. 
* Eliminates the need to manually set up the rights after each company addition.


Configuration
=============
* Add the user of your choice to the new "Automatic Access to New Companies" group

Usage
=====
* Just create a new company - users in the group get their access rights updated automatically

Known issues / Roadmap
======================
